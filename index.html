        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <p>Soccer has been an integral part of my life for the past 12 years. Even though I started the sport at a very young age, never did I think it would stick with me until now. Over the years I have played thousands of minutes on the grass pitch where I have experienced every emotion known to mankind. From tears of defeat to ecstatic cheers of victory I have experienced it all. Yet, soccer was so much more for me than just a sport. Having a ball at my feet allowed me to detach from the stresses of our day-to-day life that we undoubtedly feel. Soccer also enlightened me to one of the values in life that I hold very close to my heart —— that is progression and growth. When I first started the sport I played recreation and through determination and hardwork I was able to progress all the way to the National Academy level. I have no doubts that soccer will remain with me for however long my life lasts. </p>
